# NLI2Code-MPS

This project aims to create a simpler version of Java libraries which can be easily used by new programmers (or one without programming experience).

For each target library, we utilized MPS to design a DSL, which can be easily used to generate java code using the library.

By now, there are two DSL (POI and JFreeChart) in construction. There are 30 function features in POI and 11 in JFreeChart.

Please goto **Tutorial** folder to see how to use these DSLs in MPS.
